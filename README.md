# Bore: Make Gopherholes

Tool for building your own hole in gopherspace (Gopher Protocol).

I made this because I wanted to rebuild my [Burrow](https://github.com/someodd/burrow).

It comes with its own Gopher Protocol server (ripped from [spacecookie](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie), but the gopherhole it builds can be used by pretty much any Gopher server.

## Plans to port from Burrow

* Columnation
* Possibly markdown (not sure how useful this actually is )
